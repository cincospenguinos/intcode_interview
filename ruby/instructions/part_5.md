### Part Five: Optimization
###### Adapted from Advent of Code 2019, day nine, part two.

At this point, your Intcode computer is complete and functioning. There is one last, very open-ended test.

With the same initial memory as in part four, use `2` as your input instead of `1`. Your expected output should be `49122`.
 
This will take substantially longer to run. While keeping the existing tests all green and functional, clean up any leftover code cruft and optimize what remains such that this function runs quickly.

Alternatively, look for refactoring changes that can be made. How can the code be more readable? How can it be more maintainable in the future? What experiments with the existing computer would you like to experiment with?

Keep in mind SOLID principles, clean code, and something that is easy to maintain should the need arise and something you're proud of!
